              <p>"Help me. Hey, I said help me!"</p>

              <p>You tear your eyes away from the television long enough to see a furry, four-inch spider descending from the ceiling.</p>

              <p>"Your mom is after us again! Help us!"</p>

              <p>You decide to ignore the impossibility of an arthropod with a cerebrum the size of a () somehow possessing the higher brain function to learn a human language, and then somehow developing the necessary body parts to make sounds that would be recognizable to other human beings.
              "Why should I help you? You're just another pest."</p>

              <p>"You can't judge our entire species by a few poisonous apples!" the spider protests. "That's positively species-ist of you!"</p>

              <p>You pause to consider. "You know what? You're right. I've been grossly intolerant of other species without making any attempt to understand them. Instead
              of trying to learn more about the reasons for their existence and the intricacies of their social behavioral patterns, I merely label their presence as an inconvenience to my own and exterminate them for the sake of expediency."</p>

              <p>The spider nods. "That's right. A lot of us are totally harmless to you, you know! In fact, we eat other insects in your house that do transmit disease, like mosquitoes, fleas, flies, cockroaches... we eat practically everything else you guys kill. You should be thanking us!"</p>

              <p>"Alright then. Thanks a lot."</p>

              <p>"I don't need your meaningless thanks; I need your help!" the spider snaps. "Your mom just found a lot of us dwelling near her window, and one of our scouts just spotted her rolling up some newspaper! You know how nearsighted she is... she can't tell the difference between those of us who are poisonous and those of us who aren't hurting anybody.
              She's going to kill us all! And right after I just finished making my last mortgage payment!"</p>

              <p>You decide to ignore the poorly-written joke and simply volunteer your help so that you can commence playing this game. "Alright. I'll help. What do you want me to do?"</p>

              <p>"Just tell her you'll take care of the spider situation. I have no problem sacrificing all my poisonous relatives just to save my kind," the spider replies.
              "We'll teach you how to recognize the difference between the poisonous ones and the harmless ones so that you can selectively exterminate."</p>

              <p>"So... you want me to save your species by killing off part of your species."</p>

              <p>"It's called a paradox. You need to pay more attention in school." The spider sighs. "Whatever. The point is, you're our only hope. Only you can <span>save our spiders!</span></p>

              <p>Your job is to kill as many black widow spiders as you can. Your score will increase every time you kill a black widow;
              however, if you accidentally kill a harmless jumping spider, your score will decrease. Get 13 points in under 30 seconds and you win!</p>

              <p><span>Jumping spiders</span> are the largest family of spiders, making up 13% of the species. They have a flap on their butt called a "bum flap,"
              and it varies in color depending on the spider. They have eight eyes in two distinct rows that allow them an almost 360-degree view. They move like Spiderman --
              they first attach a silk safety rope to where they are, and then they jump forward, ensuring that they'll always land safely at their next location.

              <p>The female <span>black widows</span> have a black hourglass body and red spots on its belly. The venom from its bite is said to be 15 times stronger than a rattlesnake's. However, very
               few reported bite cases end in death. The male black widows are gray or brown, and are completely harmless to humans. The female spiders sometimes kill and eat their partners after mating,
               which gave this infamous spider its name.
